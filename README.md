# Super-Mario-3d-World-Mod-Downloader (C# Branch)
This branch is dedicated to a C# version of the repo.
# Info
~~Due to the version zips being far too large for Github hosting, the program will make you go to the download page from Gamebanana. This is something I cannot fix.~~
**Fixed** with use of `curl -L`
- Note that there is a csproj referenced in the code that unaccessable. This is intentional due to it containing the TitleIDs for SM3DW. I will potentially supply the .dll in the repo if I feel it's safe to.
# Requirements
- cURL installed to PATH. **Note: If you have version 1803 or later of Windows 10, cURL is installed to PATH by default** [Refer to this tutorial if you are not on that Windows 10 version.](https://develop.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001068567-Installing-and-using-cURL#install)
