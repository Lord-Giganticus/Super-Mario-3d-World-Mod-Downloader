# Super-Mario-3d-World-Repainted-Downloader
A python script to download my mod, Super Mario 3d World: Repainted.
# Info
~~Due to the version zips being far too large for Github hosting, the program will make you go to the download page from Gamebanana. This is something I cannot fix.~~
**Fixed** with use of `curl -L`
# Usage
`py -3 "SM3DWR Installer.py"`
# Requirements
The script requires usage of the win32api module which can be installed by running `py -3 -m pip install pywin32`.
